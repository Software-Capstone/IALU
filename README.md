"# IALU" 

IALU is an annual event for Lasallian educators held in Rome. 

Lewis has sent three employees there every summer. The two-week program concludes with group presentations on how the participants will strengthen the Lasallian mission at their respective institutions. Last summer, Ryan Butt, Liz Sturm, and Ellen Thursby attended from Lewis and proposed creating a mobile app employees at all Lasallian universities could use to share resources and communicate with each other. They are reaching out to us to build it.

Attached are screen shots of a mock-up Liz Sturm created. Their text proposal is also attached.
Let me highlight some features they want in the app:
* list of insitutions by region and their featured programs
* list of social media links
* link to DLS Footsteps publication
* link to the new IALU website
* link to Lasallian research website
* link to Access Journal (from St. Mary's University in Minnesota)
* an RSS feed of news (or should we just embed a Twitter stream?)
They have (or can get) access to a folder of images we can use.
They want this app for both iOS and Android
A lot, if not all, of this strikes me as a website rather than a mobile app, but it can be made a mobile app too.
